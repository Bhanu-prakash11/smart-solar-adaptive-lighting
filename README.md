# smart-solar-adaptive-lighting
Smart Solar Adaptive Lighting System is an energy-efficient lighting solution using Arduino, LDR, and PIR sensors to automatically adjust brightness based on ambient light and motion. Powered by solar energy, it optimizes power usage by delivering 100% brightness during motion and 50% in low-light idle conditions.
